        <h1>What is MRI Characterization?</h1>
        <br>
        MRI Characterization is an automatic post-treatment of MRI acquisition which characterizes, by
        imaging, the radio frequency (RF) coils in term of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) correlated to a
        uniform volume located in depth. The main interest is to compare the RF coils on a MRI system to
        find the one that is the most suitable for a study or to compare the MRI systems between themselves.
        Comparison can be done on Bruker, Siemens, GE or Philips MRI systems. Secondary interest is to
        realize a quality control of the MRI system + RF coil throughout the time. And the last interest is to
        find an optimal performance of the MRI system by changing the sequence parameters and/or by
        changing the configuration of the coil (position, operating mode, etc...).

        Within VIP, you can currently:
        <ul>
            <li>Create phantom files</li>
            <li>Create coil files</li>
            <li>Upload the DICOM data to analyse</li>
            <li>Execute the main coil characterization program</li>
            <li>Retrieve the report file</li>
        </ul>
